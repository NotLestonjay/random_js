# random Javascripts

----------------------

I did not make all of these, credit to the owners of some of the bookmarklets. This is just a storage of (most) of the bookmarklets I have in my folders and some that I made.

# How to install
Copy a bookmarklet that you have, create a bookmark and click "More" then
change the url to the bookmarklet you copied. Click it whenever you want.
Bookmarklets don't work on all websites. Some may have policies, or just don't work.

# What is A bookmarklet?

A bookmarklet is like a bookmark for those websites, but it contains javascript that can be run on the current webpage. They only have one line. if you want to turn javascript into one line, use a javascript compresser then add javascript: infront of the js that was compressed.

'''javascript
javascript:alert("Hello, world!")
'
